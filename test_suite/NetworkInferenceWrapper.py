    Attributes
    ----------
    expression_data : pd.DataFrame
        Gene expression data stored in a data frame with sample identifiers as indices and 
        gene symbols as column names. Must be set explicitly before calling infer_networks().
    
    partition : list
        A list of lists containing sample identifiers for samples that fall into the different 
        blocks of the sample partition. Must be set explicitly before calling infer_networks().
    
    _inferred_networks : list
        A list of data frames with gene symbols as indices and column names whose entries correspond to
        edge scores in inferred network for the different blocks contained in self.partition.
    
    Methods
    -------
    infer_networks():
        Infers all networks for the stored partition and expression data.
    
    mean_jaccard_index_at_k(k):
        Returns the mean Jaccard index for the top k edges in the inferred networks.
    
    _get_top_k_edges(i, k):
        Abstract method to returns the top k edges for the inferred network for block i. 
        Must be implemented by derived classes.
    
    Static methods
    --------------
